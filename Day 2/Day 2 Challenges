#Bmi Calculator

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

#BMI is calculated as weight divided by the square of your height. 
#changing new variables to float instead of int because when chaning from pounds to kilos it is often a decimal
#changing back to an integer for final calculation so it's a clean number. 

height_Meter = float(height)

print("Your BMI is: ")

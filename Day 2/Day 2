Day 2
Understanding Data Types and Manipulating strings. 
1/12/2022

Using Len() command on a string of numbers produces an error. len() only works with strings.

Data Types

string
print("hello"[0])

 #Data Types

 #String

"123"
print("123"+"345")

print("Hello"[4])
#Pulls an element from a string and starts from 0 code above will produce H
#It is called subscripting.

# Integer
# Is numbers that can be used to do Math
# If you want large numbers with commas in them in your code you replace with underscore.
#123,321,000 is 123_321_000. The comma is a seperator and would not work the way you expect. 

print(123_321_000)
print(1+2+3+4)

#Float
#Short for floating point number or a decimal value. So 3.14 or something like that. 

3.14159

#Boolean

True
False

Just like we found yesterday you cannot Concatenate a string and an integer. To find the type of data you are using you would use the type()command
print(type(2))

#so Different types are float(Floatingpoint) int(integer) str(string) bool()

# Mathematics
# Different operators are + - * /. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. ** is for exponents 2**3 is two to the power of 3
# Uses PEMDAS for order of priority. 
#Paranethesis ()
# Exponents ** 
# Multiplication */ whichever is farthest to the left hapens first
# Division / * Whichever is farthest to the left happens first
# Addition + 
# Subtraction -
# print(3*3/3-3) happens from left to right because multiplication and division has the same priority.

# Day 5 Loops

## For Loop

''for'' loops iterate over lists,tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings and ``range()``; until either something happens to make them stop(``break``), or they get to the end of their list/range. <br>

Example:
```
for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item
```

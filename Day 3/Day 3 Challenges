#Challenge 1
#Find out if a number is odd or even!

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

factor = number % 2

if factor == 0:
  print("Your number is Even. ")

else:
  print("Your Number is Odd")

# Even numbers divide Cleanly into 2 whereas odd numbers have a remainder. 

#Challenge 2 
# Improved BMI calculator

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

bmi = weight / (height**2)
bmi = round(bmi,1)
#Under 18.5 they are underweight
#Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#Above 35 they are clinically obese.

if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f" You are under weight. BMI: {bmi}" )
  
elif bmi <= 25:
  print(f"You are a normal weight. BMI: {bmi}" )
elif  bmi <= 30:
    print(f" You are slightly overweight. BMI: {bmi}" )
elif bmi <= 35:
    print(f"Unfortunately you are Obese. BMI{bmi}")
else: 
  print(f"You are Clinically Obese. {bmi}" )

# Elif needs to be o nthe same line as the if statement. It cannot be nested below without an if statement before it. it checks if first statement is true, if it is there would not be a false statement directly beneath and that's what was messing me up.

#Challenge 3
#Leap Year Calculator

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#   **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400`
#e.g. The year 2000:

#2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

#2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

#2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

#So the year 2000 is a leap year.

mod_Year1 = bool(year % 4 ==0)
mod_Year2 = bool(year % 100 == 0)
mod_Year3 = bool(year % 400 == 0)

#print(mod_Year1, mod_Year2, mod_Year3)
if mod_Year1 == True:
  if mod_Year2 == True:
    if mod_Year3 == True:
      print("It's A Leap Year")
    else:
      print("It's NOT a Leap Year")
else:
  print("It's NOT a Leap year")
  #  print("It's A leap Year")
   # print("It's not a Leap Year")
# So you need that last else statement if the first statement is false or the program doesn't print out any information.

# Elif needs to be o nthe same line as the if statement. It cannot be nested below without an if statement before it. it checks if first statement is true, if it is there would not be a false statement directly beneath and that's what was messing me up.

#Challenge 3
#Leap Year Calculator

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#   **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400`
#e.g. The year 2000:

#2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

#2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

#2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

#So the year 2000 is a leap year.

mod_Year1 = bool(year % 4 ==0)
mod_Year2 = bool(year % 100 == 0)
mod_Year3 = bool(year % 400 == 0)
print(mod_Year1,mod_Year2,mod_Year3)
#if mod_Year1 == True + mod_Year2 == True + mod_Year3 == True:
 # print("It's A leap Year")

if mod_Year1 == True: 
  if mod_Year2 == True:
    if mod_Year3 == True:
      print("It's A Leap Year")

    else:
      print("It's not a Leap Year")
  else:
    print("It's a Leap Year")
else:
  print("It's not a Leap Year")
# So you need that last else statement if the first statement is false or the program doesn't print out any information.

# Instructions

#Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. 

#Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. 

#Small Pizza: $15
#Medium Pizza: $20
#Large Pizza: $25
#Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
#Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
#Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

# Example Input
#size = "L"
#add_pepperoni = "Y"
#extra_cheese = "N"

# Example Output

#Your final bill is: $28.
#e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen: 

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

if size == "S" or "s" :
